# Structuring the "LOSC_Event_tutorial"

This project attempts to, as an assignment submission for the [Spring 2023 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/site/), create a reproducible research package by adding Binder support and a working conda environment. 

Below is the Binder badge leading directly to the LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb notebook.
